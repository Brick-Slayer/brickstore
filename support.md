BrickStore is freely available as open-source software, but people have asked me if they
could support the development with donations:

When you click the Donate button below, you will be taken to the PayPal
website where you will be able to donate any amount to the BrickStore
project, even on an monthly subscription basis (your credit card will be
automatically charged each month via PayPal until you cancel this monthly
donation).
