There's no written documentation or built-in tutorial mode for BrickStore,
but most UI elements have tool-tips: just hover your mouse pointer over an
element and you'll get a short description.

In addition, there's a bunch of videos out on YouTube that should help you out.

With new videos popping up all the time, it's hard to keep this list up to date though.
Your best bet for helpful videos that aren't completely outdated, search for `brickstore` on YouTube, click `Filter` and sort by `Upload date`.

Here's a convenient link for that: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brickstore&sp=CAI%253D
