This Privacy Policy describes BrickStore's policies and procedures on the collection, use and
disclosure of your information when you use the app.

First and foremost: all data that is entered in the app never leaves your
device!
This of course explictly applies to your BrickLink username and password.

There is the option to send a bug report to the developer. This may include data about
your currently open documents. However, this will never be sent without your consent and
never without your manual interaction.

See [this page](https://github.com/rgriebl/brickstore/wiki/Crash-Reporting) for more
information.

All the app's source code is open source and can be found on GitHub. Feel free to have a look
and confirm this privacy policy.
